\section*{Course Description}
\paragraph{}This course is designed to provide an introduction to problem solving and computer programming that does not require prior programming experience. Elementary problem solving skills and algorithm development will be introduced. Students will be taught the basic use of a programming environment and basic programming constructs (including loops, control statements, functions, and arrays).

\paragraph{Note:}This course does not fulfill any of the computer science major requirements. Students who have taken and received transfer credit for, or who are taking concurrently any computer programming course in a high-level programming language, will not receive credit for CMSC 104. The list of such computer programming courses includes, but is not limited to AP Computer Science, CMSC 201, CMSC 202, and sections of CMSC 291 that cover programming topics.

The following is a list of the topics that will be covered:
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduction to Computer Organization and Architecture
\item Data Representation and Memory Usage
\item Algorithm Design
\item Programming in Python
\end{itemize}

\section*{Overall Course Objectives}
\paragraph{}After completion of this course, students will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item explain the implications of basic concepts of computer organization and architecture on program design and implementation;
    \item design basic and intermediate programs to solve problems using fundamental programming constructs (variables, loops, branching, functions);
    \item implement Python programs from designs using a development environment (optionally with Google Colab \url{https://colab.research.google.com/});
    \item describe how data is represented in memory and the relationship of these representations to Python variable types;
    \item explain the concept of an object and use objects \& functions from libraries, including the graphics, file access, and string formatting libraries;
    \item describe the concept of an algorithm and be able to design simple algorithms, including recursive algorithms;
    \item explain applications of computation in their chosen field.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Course Textbook}
\paragraph{}The Python programming book is the textbook for this course, and there is assigned reading in the course \hyperlink{sec:sechedule}{schedule} below corresponding to chapters in this book.

\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{Images/PythonThirdFrontCover}

\paragraph{}\textbf{Python Programming: An Introduction} by John Zelle, Third Edition. Franklin, ISBN 978-1-59028-275-5. e-book available at \url{https://redshelf.com}.

\subsection*{Optional Book}
\paragraph{}\textit{Code to Joy} is a great book about programming in general, and discusses the topic in a non-textbook format without discussing or including code. Instead it focuses on thinking like a programmer and how programming can help solve problems.

\includegraphics{Images/CodeToJoy}

\paragraph{}\textbf{Code to Joy: Why Everyone Should Learn a Little Programming} by Michael Littman. MIT, ISBN: 978-0-262-54639-3.

\section*{Course Work}\label{sec:coursework}
\paragraph{Attendance}It is important to be present for each class, though it's up to each individual student to best manage their own time. This is your time to have regular interaction with the instructor and Teaching Fellow, to ask questions, ask for specific examples, seek clarification, etc. I cannot overstate the importance of being able to ask questions and engage in dialog to help facilitate the learning process. \textbf{The students who end up being the most successful are the ones who regularly attend class \underline{and} ask questions!}

\paragraph{Software}If you're using a Windows computer, you'll need to download and install Python from \href{https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/}{python.org}. If you have a Mac, Python is already installed, but you may want to install a newer version from \href{https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/}{python.org}. In both cases, make sure to install ``IDLE''. Additionally, you may wish to install PyCharm Community Edition from \url{https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/}. Both are free.

\paragraph{}A third option is to use Google Colabatory, available at \url{https://colab.research.google.com/} which doesn't require software installation.

\label{sec:cwhw}
\paragraph{Classwork \& Projects}Classwork will be submitted using Blackboard, and are due precisely one week after being assigned. For example, Classwork 1 is assigned on Thursday, January 20\textsuperscript{th}, therefore the due date is 11:59 PM on Wednesday, February 5\textsuperscript{th}. Assignments may be completed early, but \underline{\hypertarget{sec:cwhw}{late assignments} will \textbf{not}} \underline{be accepted}\footnote{Late assignments may be accepted \textit{only} in the event of a documented extenuating circumstance.}. Projects are due two weeks after assignment. Classwork and Projects indicate the assignment \& due dates.

\paragraph{Quizzes}There are four quizzes and they will be held during the first 40 minutes of the class in which they're administered. The best ways to study for the quiz is to attend class, ask questions, read the assigned chapters in the textbook, and complete the assignments. Some of the quiz questions are taken from the textbook's end of chapter questions. Each quiz will focus on the materials since the quiz prior, including assigned readings, and will be \textit{cumulative}. Quizzes will be administered using the Respondus Lockdown Browser in Blackboard, so please read the following section for details on how to set it up and use it. There will be a practice quiz early in the semester to ensure everyone can use the system on their devices to ensure there will not be any surprises on quiz days.

\paragraph{LockDown Browser}This course uses the LockDown Browser for the quizzes and final exam. Watch this short video to get a basic understanding of LockDown Browser \url{http://www.respondus.com/products/lockdown-browser/student-movie.shtml}. Then download and install LockDown Browser from this link: \url{http://www.respondus.com/lockdown/download.php?id=978442813}. NOTE: This link is unique for UMBC. It cannot be used by non-UMBC students or websites outside of our campus. To take an online test, start LockDown Browser and navigate to the exam. You won't be able to access the exam with a standard web browser. For additional details on using LockDown Browser, review this FAQ \url{https://wiki.umbc.edu/x/BQb9Aw} or the Respondus Student Quick Start Guide (PDF) \url{http://respondus.com/products/lockdown-browser/guides.shtml#student}. Finally, when taking an online exam, follow these guidelines:
\begin{itemize}
\item Before starting the test, know how much time is available for it, and that you've allotted sufficient time to complete it;
\item Turn off all mobile devices, phones, etc. and don't have them within reach;
\item Remain at your desk or workstation for the duration of the quiz or exam;
\item LockDown Browser will prevent you from accessing other websites or applications; you will be unable to exit the test until all questions are completed and submitted.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Exams}There will be one exam, the final, which will also use the LockDown Browser. It is designed to reinforce the topics discussed throughout the semester in order to promote retention of the information. The exam will take place in the classroom at the time indicated in the schedule.

\section*{Course Policies}
\subsection*{Grading}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c c || c c}
\multicolumn{2}{c||}{\underline{Scale}} & \underline{Course Work} & \underline{Grade Distribution} \\
90\% - 100\% & A & Classwork & 15\% \\
80\% - 89\%  & B & Projects & 25\% \\
70\% - 79\%  & C & Quizzes & 30\% \\
60\% - 69\%  & D & Final Exam & 30\% \\
$<$60\%      & F &
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\paragraph{}For borderline grades, there may be adjustments in the student's favor based on attendance, but under no circumstances will the letter grades be lower than in the standard formula. Grades will not be ``curved'' in the sense that the percentages of A's, B's and C's are not fixed. As a guideline, a student receiving an ``A'' should be able to produce correct programs for the all of the assignments and quizzes with ease. As stated in the \hyperlink{sec:cwhw}{Classwork \& Projects} section, late work will not be accepted.

\subsection*{Academic Integrity}
\paragraph{}By enrolling is this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UMBC's scholarly community in which everyone's academic work and behavior are held to the highest standards of honesty. Cheating, using ChatGPT or other AI, fabrication, plagiarism, or helping others to commit these acts are all forms of academic dishonesty and there is no place for them in this class. Academic misconduct could result in disciplinary action that may include, but is not limited to, suspension or dismissal. To find useful information about avoiding plagiarism infractions through appropriate citations, or to read the full policy regarding student academic misconduct for the graduate school, please see \url{http://www.umbc.edu/provost/integrity}.

\paragraph{}You are allowed \& \textit{encouraged} to discuss course materials with your peers! Please do talk about the assignments, computing, programming, and other related topics. However, \underline{all assignments are an individual effort!} \underline{Do not share your code.} Assignments will be checked for evidence of shared or copied code. If you have questions, or find that you are struggling, please ask questions, but \underline{do not share code}\textbf{!}

\paragraph{}Please refrain from trying to find code online to help with your assignment. As stated a few times, if you are having trouble, then please ask for help during class, after class, or in an email. If you find yourself too tempted and do this anyway, include that URL in the assignment itself:
\begin{itemize}
\item Cite your source, don't claim it as your own,
\item If you and another student happen to use the same site and don't cite, that will be interpreted as cheating and a zero will be given for the assignment.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{ChatGPT} \underline{Do not use ChatGPT} or any other type of AI for your assignments. This doesn't help you learn, and ChatGPT has been known to give incorrect responses. You learn by doing, making mistakes, figuring out how to fix the mistakes, and repeating. Being given potentially incorrect answers is not learning. If you need help with the course material, please ask questions! \underline{Any submitted materials which are suspected to have} \underline{been AI-generated will earn a zero and will count as cheating!} Repeat offenders will be reported to the Dean's office.

\section*{Schedule}\label{sec:schedule}
\textit{Note: The schedule is subject to change. However, any changes will be thoroughly discussed and well disseminated. Please read the chapter \underline{before} class starts.}
